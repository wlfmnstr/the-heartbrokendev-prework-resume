    <p><strong>Passions:</strong> Coding, Teaching, Recovering, Healing</p>

    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>
      Hello, I'm a Principal Software Engineer with a heart recently shattered
      into more pieces than a monolithic application being refactored into
      microservices. Despite the deep fissures in my heart, my spirit for coding
      and teaching burns brighter than a well-optimized algorithm. My journey
      through the valley of heartbreak has led me to a profound realization:
      healing is found not by looking inward but by reaching outward. With a
      career spent helming engineering projects in Fortune 10 enterprises, I've
      decided to pivot my expertise towards something infinitely more
      valuable—teaching you to code.

    <h3>Personal Statement</h3>
    <p>
      In the darkest of times, when the code of my life seemed riddled with
      bugs, I found my purpose illuminated by the glow of my IDE. I've learned
      that the path to mending a broken heart is paved with curly braces,
      semicolons, and the smiles of those I can help along the way. My mission
      is simple: to offer you my time, my knowledge, and perhaps, a piece of my
      heart, as we embark on this journey of learning and healing together. I'm
      not looking for payment, accolades, or even recognition—I'm searching for
      connection, for meaning, and for the chance to make a difference in your
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you're willing to commit to this journey, I promise to be there every
      step of the way, from "Hello, World!" to deploying your first app. Let's
      build something beautiful together, not just in code, but in the very
      fabric of our lives.
    </p>
    <p>Last but not least, I love you all. :)</p>
