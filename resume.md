### About Me

Hello, I'm a Principal Software Engineer with a heart recently shattered into more pieces than a monolithic application being refactored into microservices. Despite the deep fissures in my heart, my spirit for coding and teaching burns brighter than a well-optimized algorithm. My journey through the valley of heartbreak has led me to a profound realization: healing is found not by looking inward but by reaching outward. With a career spent helming engineering projects in Fortune 10 enterprises, I've decided to pivot my expertise towards something infinitely more valuable—teaching you to code.

### Personal Statement

In the darkest of times, when the code of my life seemed riddled with bugs, I found my purpose illuminated by the glow of my IDE. I've learned that the path to mending a broken heart is paved with curly braces, semicolons, and the smiles of those I can help along the way. My mission is simple: to offer you my time, my knowledge, and perhaps, a piece of my heart, as we embark on this journey of learning and healing together. I'm not looking for payment, accolades, or even recognition—I'm searching for connection, for meaning, and for the chance to make a difference in your life.

If you're willing to commit to this journey, I promise to be there every step of the way, from "Hello, World!" to deploying your first app. Let's build something beautiful together, not just in code, but in the very fabric of our lives.

**Last but not least, I love you all. :)**
